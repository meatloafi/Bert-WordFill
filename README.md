# EXAMPLES

There is some good in this [MASK], and it’s worth fighting for.
Hi [MASK] are you?
It is [MASK] with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
 I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no [MASK] what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.
A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it [MASK]? Have I done well — or ill?
The only way out of [MASK] labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.
To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the [MASK], Thou canst not then be false to any man
